# Red Hat AI Innovation Team 👋

Welcome to the Red Hat AI Innovation Team's GitHub organization! We are a team of passionate engineers and researchers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence and machine learning within Red Hat and the open-source community.

## About

This GitHub organization serves as the home for the AI Innovation Team's latest projects, libraries, and SDKs. For any papers or blogs on language model reasoning, inference-time scaling, model compression, reinforcement learning, etc., the code can be found right here!

## Getting Started

### Learning

To keep up with the latest from the AI Innovation team, check out our home page [here](https://red-hat-ai-innovation-team.github.io/)!

We also have a podcast series, "No Math AI", available on [youtube](https://youtu.be/QEDGOEJxQk4?si=zOpROD1ivkt_4c6L) and [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1FJKF0HR03pUNxeEN5BwEM?si=zgpty0FFTcCdGnAcThhOxg)

### Quick Start

As our libraries continue to evolve, we will continue to provide documentation, tutorials, example notebooks, and more.
For example, see our recent notebook on [customizing reasoning models with your data](https://github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/SDG-Research/tree/main/examples/knowledge_generation_using_nemotron) 👀

## Development

See more details in any of the repos in this organization, and go to their issues page for open tasks/issues!

### Getting Involved

While we set up an easy path to reach out, feel free to message any of the core contributers in our repos.

### License

Unless otherwise noted within a specific repo, all projects are licensed under the Apache-2.0 License.

### Continuous Improvement

Rather than keeping code private until it is ready for production, we believe in a more transparent, community-oriented development approach. For that reason, many of our repos will be receiving frequent updates and refinements, and robustness will continue to improve over time.
